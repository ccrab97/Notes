狗生 一

小Bailey还不叫Bailey，在车里几乎要闷死的时候，我心都悬到了嗓子眼。遇到小男孩Ethan，它有了名字“Bailey Bailey Bailey Bailey”。之后的岁月，它与teen Ethan一起作伴，玩耍，在被子里听Ethan讲故事，帮Ethan撩喜欢的女孩的裙底。。这个犯了错摇着尾巴，一脸呆萌不知道错在哪里的小家伙，好几次让人忍俊不禁啊～真想抱着这只红毛猎犬，好好亲一亲。在他的这个轮回里，他的使命就是Ethan。Ethan酗酒的父亲，在饭桌上莫名谈论政治；在和老板夫妇的饭桌上，准备显摆他收藏的rare coin；。。这些沉闷的成人细节里，Bailey的陪伴，捣蛋，为Ethan本该有些阴郁的童年，增添了诸多绚烂美妙的色彩。成年的Ethan求学远去，Bailey叼着球一路追赶Ethan乘坐的车时，我听到影院有断断续续抽泣的声音。可我眼眶的湿润还没缓过劲来，在等待中老去的Bailey就生了病。混沌中Ethan终于回来了，Bailey眼里，我的Ethan你正值青春，我却垂垂老矣。。在Ethan的注视下他视线越来越模糊，Bailey走向了死亡。

Bailey之后的轮回，他变成了威风凛凛的警犬Ellie。在这个狗生里，她被赋予的使命是协助人类破案。smell，find，and show，她总是陪伴在主人身边，站在领奖台上接受荣誉。在主人孤单只影的夜里，睡在狗窝的Ellie总是摇晃着尾巴蹭进主人房里。她多么期待能睡在主人身边，默默彼此陪伴，而主人总是冷冷的说no。Ellie眨着一对双眼，头耷拉在床榻，主人终于说了yes！她跃上主人的床，高兴的躺在主人身边，她夜晚终于不用夹着尾巴落寞回窝。主人接到营救人质的任务，Ellie在执行任务时表现勇猛，成功救起掉入湍急河流的人质。（这也是虐狗视频流出的镜头起因，狗狗因为恐惧不敢跳入水中，而视频中见到的工作人员多少有些强迫的意思，后来片方解释是为了训练，真相到底是如何这就得见仁见智了。）在关键的一刻，Ellie扑向绑匪，为了保护主人时不幸中枪。主人眼眶含泪，抚摸着濒死的Ellie，说：Ellie，you are a good dog， you are a good dog. 正如这张“好狗卡”，在Ellie的这一生里，就像人类的青年时期，她付出了她对工作的热情，履行了对主人对社会的责任。

A dog looks to discover his purpose in life over the course of several lifetimes and owners



------

Bailey is a [Golden Retriever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Retriever) whose life is shown from his birth to his death and to his [reincarnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation) through four different [dog breeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_breeds). Each time he is reincarnated, it tells his story from life to death, except in the latest life, where he meets his original owner again.

The movie begins in an unspecified year during the 1950s. It is then that the narrator canine begins and ends a very brief life as a wild puppy who is whisked away to the dog pound and quickly put to death. The beginning of his next life is very clearly tied in to the [Cuban Missile Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis) of 1961. As a growing young doggie, Bailey is spotted inside a locked pick-up truck on a hot summer day and is rescued from certain death by a young boy named Ethan and his mother.

As the years pass, Ethan grows into a strapping high school football player who falls in love with his classmate Hannah. But events take a dark turn when Ethan's alcoholic father shoves his mother to the ground in a drunken rage. Ethan orders his father to leave and never come back. A vindictive classmate later throws a lit firecracker into Ethan's house as a harmless prank which unintentionally results in a catastrophic fire. This would surely have resulted in the deaths of a sound-asleep Ethan and his mother were it not for Bailey's quick action in rousing them from their beds. Ethan badly fractures his leg, however, during the fall from the second-story window, ending his dreams of an athletic scholarship, and he must go to [agricultural school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_school) instead. Self-pitying and embittered, he breaks off his relationship with Hannah before leaving for college. Sometime afterwards, an aged Bailey slowly expires at the veterinarian's office after sharing an eleventh-hour teary goodbye with Ethan.

Bailey reincarnates into another dog life, a female [German Shepherd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Shepherd) [K-9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog) named Ellie, while remembering his previous existence. Ellie is working with an officer, Carlos, from the [Chicago Police Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Police_Department), sometime in the early 1980s. The two form a close relationship which ends after Ellie jumps into a rushing river and saves a kidnapped girl from drowning because he is then shot and mortally wounded during a struggle with the armed kidnapper who was a moment away from killing an unsuspecting Carlos.

Reincarnated in the mid-1980s as a [Pembroke Welsh Corgi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembroke_Welsh_Corgi) named Tino, he forms a bond with Maya, a college student in Atlanta whom he helps to find true love. Maya marries and has a beautiful family who all love the Corgi. As he lies dying of old age in the late 1990s, Tino thanks Maya for giving him one of his best lives. Tino is again reincarnated to a [Saint Bernard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Bernard_(dog)) named Buddy, only to be taken in by an abusive and neglectful "[trailer trash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_trash)" couple sometime during the next decade.

Buddy is eventually dumped in an abandoned lot by the alcoholic, roughneck young man and reluctantly sets off in search of a new life. He gradually makes his way to the country area where his first life began without even realizing at first where he is headed. He joyfully reunites with his old master Ethan, who is now at the far end of middle age, living a lonely solitary life and apparently broken in spirit. Ethan, of course, initially has no idea who this wandering Saint Bernard really is and hands him over to the local animal shelter. But he soon has a change of heart and reclaims him.

Buddy, sensing that he has finally found the purpose in life that has long evaded him, finds a way to reunite Ethan with a widowed Hannah, and they eventually get married. At the movie's end, Buddy finally convinces Ethan that he is Ethan's beloved childhood pet by performing some tricks and responding to key phrases that were known only to the two of them all those many, many long years ago
